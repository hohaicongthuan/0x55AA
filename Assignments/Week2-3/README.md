# Assignment Week #2 & #3

## 1. Tasks

Create and simulate a colourspace converter **(RGB ⇌ Greyscale)** using Python and Verilog, and then compare the two results.

* Input: an image
* Output: three images
  * one is the result from Python
  * one is from Verilog
  * one is the difference between the former two.

## 2. Algorithm

RGB[A] to Grey: ```Y ← 0.299 × R + 0.587 × G + 0.114 × B```

## 3. Plan

### 3.1. Python
- [ ] Image to Bitmap Text Converter
- [ ] Bitmap Text to Image Converter
- [ ] RGB ⇌ Greyscale Converter
- [ ] Images comparator

### 3.2. Verilog
- [ ] Floating-point adder
- [ ] Floating-point multiplier
- [ ] RGB ⇌ Greyscale Converter
